## *work in progress*

## Description

Many people save notes, articles, pictures and more, to use sometime in the future, maybe for an article or for their studies. There are many reasons to save information, but what if you want to see it because you need inspiration to write that article, or to look at something specific for your research? 

The Information Inspiration app enables users to keep the information they want to save in one place. It is a very practical solution: store your notes, pictures, links etc. on cards with a title, a description, and a date. You can add search tags if you prefer to work with tags. The info cards are saved in the local storage of the browser that is used (note: the info cards are not available when using a different browser: local storage is specific to a browser and is not a database).

The user can:

-  create information cards with title, description, search tags and date
-  search, view, edit and delete information cards
-  through the search function, obtain an overview of all the information cards that contain the search term

## Backlog
-  automatically keep last search on start page
-  create functionality to keep list of tags used
-  enable uploading of images
-  enable attaching of files
